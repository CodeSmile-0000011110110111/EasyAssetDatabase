 Imagine Unity\textquotesingle{}s Asset\+Database were self-\/explanatory, enjoyable to use, consistent in design and behaviour, well documented, resulting in concise code that prevents disasters.\hypertarget{index_bam-now-it-is-}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Bam, now it is! \+:)}{Bam, now it is! \+:)}}\label{index_bam-now-it-is-}
\hypertarget{index_why-did-i-create-this}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Why did I create this?}{Why did I create this?}}\label{index_why-did-i-create-this}
The Asset\+Database is \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/134BEPXTx3z80snNAF3Gafgq3j5kEhmFzFBKT_z1s6Rw/edit?usp=sharing}{\texttt{ heavily fragmented into verbosely named, losely related static methods}} with inconsistent signatures and varying side-\/effects. It\textquotesingle{}s functional, but it\textquotesingle{}s design is fundamentally broken (absent), leading to terrible code written against it.

Developers commonly employ a trial-\/and-\/error approach. Trivial tasks take much longer than estimated. Edge-\/cases remain to be discovered later. There is a real risk of data loss due to a simple mistake. Cargo-\/cult and copy-\/pasta programming needlessly degrade editor performance.

You\textquotesingle{}ll find such bad examples even in popular Asset Store tools used by big game studios!

A clean start with a modern API is the best way to solve these issues, speed up developing editor tools, ensure scripts are devoid of edge-\/cases and will not fail on any editor platform.

That is what {\bfseries{Code\+Smile Asset\+Database}} provides.\hypertarget{index_main-features}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Main Features}{Main Features}}\label{index_main-features}
The main class is {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_code_smile_editor_1_1_asset}{Code\+Smile\+Editor.\+Asset}} which provides a static API but it\textquotesingle{}s also instantiable.

The Asset instance provides access to asset-\/specific operations and alleviates you from managing separate state (eg asset path, GUID, sub assets, etc).

The {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_code_smile_editor_1_1_asset_1_1_path}{Code\+Smile\+Editor.\+Asset.\+Path}} handles asset paths, ensures they are relative and compatible across editor platforms, validates correctness in regards to file system and assets, and provides all path operations and representations (.meta, full path, etc).

Unity\textquotesingle{}s Asset\+Database and existing scripts using it are NOT altered or affected in any way.

BONUS\+: \href{https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.assetinspector}{\texttt{ Asset Inspector}} -\/ view and inspect every (!) detail of selected assets. It also \href{https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.assetinspector/blob/main/Editor/AssetInspector.cs}{\texttt{ serves as a showcase}} for Code\+Smile Asset\+Database.

There\textquotesingle{}s a whole lot more so be sure to explore and discover!\hypertarget{index_example-code-snippets}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Example Code Snippets}{Example Code Snippets}}\label{index_example-code-snippets}
Load and Create assets\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Asset asset = "{}\+Assets/\+Folder/\+Data.\+asset"{};}
\item {\ttfamily var asset = new Asset(bytes, "{}\+Assets/\+Folder/\+Data.\+asset"{});}
\item {\ttfamily var obj = Asset.\+File.\+Create(str, "{}\+Assets/\+Folder/\+Data.\+asset"{});}
\item {\ttfamily var obj = Asset.\+File.\+Create\+As\+New(bytes, "{}\+Assets/\+Folder/\+Data.\+asset"{});}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Notice the hands-\/free, does-\/what-\/you-\/need approach.

What\textquotesingle{}s not noticable here is that any non-\/existing folder in the path is automatically created. Countless asset scripts fail the first time an actual user runs it. I know YOU know it! You read this far! ;)

Other file operations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily asset.\+Force\+Save();}
\item {\ttfamily var asset\+Dupe = asset.\+Duplicate();}
\item {\ttfamily asset\+Dupe.\+Delete();}
\item {\ttfamily var copy = asset.\+Save\+As\+New("{}\+Assets/\+Elsewhere/\+Dada.\+asset"{});}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Type conversion\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily var obj = asset.\+Main\+Object;}
\item {\ttfamily var level\+Data = asset.\+Get\+Main\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Level\+Data\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}();}
\item {\ttfamily var level\+Data = (Level\+Data)asset;}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Asset.\+Path examples\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily var path = new Asset.\+Path(@"{}\+C\+:\textbackslash{}\+My\+Projects\textbackslash{}\+Fudnite\+Clone\textbackslash{}\+Assets\textbackslash{}my.\+asset"{});}
\item {\ttfamily path.\+Create\+Folders();}
\item {\ttfamily var absolute\+Path = path.\+Full\+Path;}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Performance\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Asset.\+File.\+Batch\+Editing(() =\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} \{ /\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} mass file IO \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}/ \});}
\item {\ttfamily Asset.\+File.\+Import(paths);}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Work with Sub-\/\+Assets\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily asset.\+Add\+Sub\+Asset(sub\+Data);}
\item {\ttfamily var sub\+Assets = asset.\+Sub\+Assets;}
\end{DoxyItemize}

You\textquotesingle{}ll commonly get or set dependencies, importers, labels, paths, asset bundles, etc. via instance properties.

Complete\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily asset.\+Export\+Package("{}\+I\+:/leveldata.\+unitypackage"{});}
\item {\ttfamily asset.\+Active\+Importer = typeof(\+My\+Data\+Importer);}
\item {\ttfamily Asset.\+Database.\+Import\+All();} // Hint\+: this is "{}\+Refresh()"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

You\textquotesingle{}ll also find Cache Server, Version Control, etc. in well-\/defined, logical places.

Error Handling\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily var msg = Asset.\+Get\+Last\+Error\+Message();} // A file operation failed? Check the error string
\end{DoxyItemize}

Exceptions are also thrown for malformed input to make the API more resilient and reliable, rather than calls silently failing or printing unhelpful console logs.\hypertarget{index_documentation--support}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Documentation \& Support}{Documentation \& Support}}\label{index_documentation--support}
The \href{https://codesmile-0000011110110111.github.io/de.codesmile.assetdatabase/html/index.html}{\texttt{ API documentation}} is more complete with more details and caveats mentioned than Unity\textquotesingle{}s. Of course you\textquotesingle{}ll find these snippets right in your IDE as tooltips.

I care. A lot.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The API has been designed to be concise, approachable, elegant, consistent, explorable, complete and whole lot more buzzwords -\/ except they actually mean something to me.
\end{DoxyItemize}

I work obsessively.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All Asset\+Database methods are included.
\item The Asset Inspector window lets you inspect every detail of selected assets in the project.
\end{DoxyItemize}

I follow best practices.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Included are extensive test cases, the file I/O operations specifically have 100\% test coverage. The tests also serve to instruct by example.
\end{DoxyItemize}

I like to share knowledge.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The documentation is exhaustive, well structured, and contains more information than what you\textquotesingle{}ll find in Unity\textquotesingle{}s manual and script reference.
\end{DoxyItemize}

I\textquotesingle{}m also deeply honest. And I trust you.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Admittedly, a very fringe method that returns a Native\+Array has been omitted to avoid having to depend on com.\+unity.\+collections. Just so you know.
\item You can \href{https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.assetdatabase}{\texttt{ demo the project on Git\+Hub}} where it\textquotesingle{}s available for free but released under the terms of the GNU GPL 3.\+0.
